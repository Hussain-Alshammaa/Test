        The key extension in marked-it has to do with the ability to use metadata attributes in Markdown. An attribute is a name or a name-value mapping that can be bound to a Markdown element. Then, attributes are passed through to the resulting generated HTML5 elements and output as classes. They are often used to ensure correct CSS styling of the generated HTML5 output. After your attributes are defined, you can apply these values to any Markdown element, like headers, paragraphs, and codeblocks.
        
        Or, you might need to define copyright and other metadata to prepend or append uniformly across the generated HTML5 output. In this extension, you can use standard header and footer files that are called during transformation. You might also need to add HTML opening and closing tags for the file based on your publishing requirements.
        
        To meet accessibility requirements, there is also an extension to add table row headers, table summaries, and figure titles. </p>
